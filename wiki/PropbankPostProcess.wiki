=== Traces ===

  * A trace is recognized as a node whose part-of-speech tag is `-NONE-`.
  * A trace must be annotated on a leaf node.  If a trace is annotated on a phrase node, post-process it so it is annotated on the leaf node (except for `*ICH*`).  For example, if a trace `*-1` from `(NP (-NONE- *-1))` is to be annotated, the annotation should be on `-NONE-`, not on `NP`.
  * If a trace comes with an index (trace ID), chain the trace with every other phrase marked with the same index in the tree.  For example, if `*T*-1 (8:0)` is annotated as `ARG0` of `was (9:0)`, then it should be chained with `WHNP-1 (7:1)` so that the result is `7:1*8:0`.

=== `*`ICH`*` traces ===

  * If a phrase node includes `*ICH*` trace as one of its descendants, take the trace ID of `*ICH*` and chain the phrase with every other phrase marked with the same trace ID.  For example, if `*-3 (4:0)` is annotated as `ARG1` of `given (3:0)`, it is first chained with `NP-SBJ-3 (0:1)` so the result is `0:1*4:0`.  Moreover, since `NP-SBJ-3` includes `*ICH*-1 (1:0)` as its descendant, it is again chained with `S-1 (5:2)` so the overall result is `0:1;5:2*4:0`.

  (. .)))

=== LINK-SLC ===

When `&` operator is used on some numbered argument (`ARG#`), keep only the last trace as the numbered argument and chain all nodes as `LINK-SLC`.  For example, if the annotation is `0:0&1:0-ARG1` where `1:0` is a trace, it is post-processed to `1:0-ARG1` and `0:0*1:0-LINK-SLC`.
