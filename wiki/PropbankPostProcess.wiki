=== Traces ===

  * A trace is recognized as a node whose part-of-speech tag is `-NONE-`.
  * A trace must be annotated on leaf-level.  If a trace is annotated on phrase-level, it should be post-processed so that it is annotated on leaf-level (except for `*ICH*`).  For example, if a trace `*-1` from `(NP (-NONE- *-1))` needs to be annotated, the annotation should be on `-NONE-`, not on `NP`.
  * If a trace comes with an index, chain the trace with every other phrase with the same index in the tree.  For example, if `*T*-1 (8:0)` is annotated as `ARG0` of `was`, then it should be chained with `WHNP-1 (7:1)` so that the result is `7:1*8:0`.
